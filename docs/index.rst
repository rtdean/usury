Usury: Making Interest Simple
=============================

Why usury?  Historically, charging any interest on a loan was considered usury.
Of course, in today's world, the term refers to the practice of loans which
abuse the lendee to enrich the lender, typically due to excessive or abusive
interest rates.

    Mr. Burns: By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury
    laws?

    Homer: Us-ury?

    Mr. Burns: Oh, silly me!  I must have just made up a word that doesn't
    exist.  Now, what is the purpose of this loan?

But that's okay, the usury library doesn't judge you.  Whether you are trying
to set up a savings and loan bank in the MMO of your choice, just trying to do
some financial planning / analysis of your debt, or maybe you fell into the trap
of loaning money to people... this library can help you do the math.


How-To Use
----------

I should probably write some documentation at some point that shows how to use
this library.  But, that time isn't now... yet.  For now, take a look at the
test suite, specifically `test_simple.py`, and the `LoanCase` test case.


The API Documentation / Guide
