Usury: Python Library for Calculating Interest
==============================================

Usury calculates interest for various types of loan types.  Currently, it has
decent support for simple-interest loans, but more should be coming soon.

Perhaps with better documentation, too.  But hey, there's always unit tests...

Installation
------------

To install usury:

.. code-block:: bash
    $ pip install usury
